# Weather_Forecast
This weather forcasting code uses polynomial regression to predict the temperature given a specific date and time. The user will input the month, date, and time and both a predicted temperature, as well as the actual temperature for 2019 will be outputted. A plot of temperature and its polynomial regression line will be also outputted for the given month. </br>

## Instillation (mac)
### Python
This code uses python. If you have already used or installed python in the past, skip this section. </br>
1. Download package from this website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Once downloaded, open package and follow instructions 
3. Using an IDE will significantly make your life easier in running and modifying the code. Examples of good IDE include PyCharm, Wing (IDE I used to run this code), Spyder. You can find and install these IDEs by searching them up online

### Libraries
To run this game, you need to install 3 python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib. These can be installed simply by opening your terminal (for mac) and typing the following:
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Notes about code
1. The data was collected from 2019 in a weather station located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Therefore, the predicted temperature is not very reliable, but it is a start
2. The code uses polynomial regression (using polyfit) from numpy to predict the temperature
